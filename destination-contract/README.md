# QST Destination Chain Contract

QubeSwapToken Destination Chain Contract 
for Bridges Use.


#### Security & Best Practices
QST is a secure, multi-owner ERC-20 token with:

✅ Standard ERC20 (transfer, approve, etc.). <br>
✅ Gasless permits (EIP-2612) approvals. <br>
✅ Admin controls (tradeable, transferOwnership). <br>
✅ Recovery mechanisms for stuck ETH/ERC20. <br>
✅ EIP-712 for secure permit signatures. <br>
✅ Reentrancy Protection: Uses ReentrancyGuard for critical functions <br>
✅ Timelock Delays: 24-hour delay for trading status changes with 
automatic execution. <br>
✅ Input Validation: Checks for zero addresses, valid tokens, etc. <br>
✅ SafeERC20: Prevents reentrancy in token transfers. <br>
✅ Multi-Owner: Reduces single-point failure risk. <br>
✅ EIP-712 Permits: Secure, typed signatures for gasless approvals. <br>
✅ Input Validation: Checks for zero addresses, valid tokens, etc. <br>
